  # To add resources to your application, add an resources section, like this:
  assets:
    - images/

  # An image asset can refer to one or more resolution-specific "variants", see
  # https://flutter.dev/assets-and-images/#resolution-aware.

  # For details regarding adding resources from package dependencies, see
  # https://flutter.dev/assets-and-images/#from-packages

  # To add custom fonts to your application, add a fonts section here,
  # in this "flutter" section. Each entry in this list should have a
  # "family" key with the font family name, and a "fonts" key with a
  # list giving the asset and other descriptors for the font. For
  # example:
  fonts:
  - family: BadScript
    fonts:
    - asset: 'fonts/BadScript-Regular.ttf'
  - family: GloriaHallelujah
    fonts:
    - asset: 'fonts/GloriaHallelujah-Regular.ttf'
  - family: Montserrat
    fonts:
    - asset: 'fonts/Montserrat-Regular.ttf'
  # see https://flutter.dev/custom-fonts/#from-packages
